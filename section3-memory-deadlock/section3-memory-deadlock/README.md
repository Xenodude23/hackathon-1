# ⚡ SECTION 3: Memory & Deadlock Simulation

## 🚨 REAL-TIME SYSTEM FAILURE: MEMORY EXHAUSTION & DEADLOCKS

### 🎯 Scenario
Your company's **real-time monitoring system** has been experiencing intermittent crashes for the past 48 hours. The system tracks sensor data from 10,000+ IoT devices and processes events in real-time. Three critical subsystems are failing:

1. **Memory Tracker** - Leaking memory on every allocation cycle
2. **Thread Manager** - Deadlocking under concurrent access
3. **Resource Scheduler** - Starving low-priority tasks

The system will run out of memory in **50 minutes** at current leak rate. Fix it before the entire infrastructure goes down.

---

## 📋 Your Mission

Fix **10 critical bugs** across 3 modules:
- `memory_tracker.py` - Memory allocation/free tracking (4 bugs)
- `thread_manager.py` - Thread lock management (3 bugs)
- `resource_scheduler.py` - Resource scheduling (3 bugs)

---

## 🚨 Known Issues

From the monitoring dashboard:

1. **Memory leak** - Allocations not tracked correctly
2. **Double free** - System crashes on freeing already-freed memory
3. **Deadlock** - Two threads waiting for each other's locks
4. **Starvation** - Low-priority tasks never execute
5. **Race condition** - Concurrent updates corrupting shared state

## 📏 Constraints

### ✅ You MAY:
- Fix tracking logic
- Add synchronization primitives
- Fix scheduling algorithms
- Add error handling

### ❌ You MAY NOT:
- Remove threading/concurrency
- Disable memory tracking
- Skip priority scheduling
- Hardcode test values

## 💡 Debugging Tips

1. **Trace memory operations** - Track every alloc and free
2. **Draw lock dependency graphs** - Visualize deadlocks
3. **Use timeouts** - Don't let threads wait forever
4. **Check ordering** - Priority queues need correct comparisons
5. **Test edge cases** - Double free, zero allocation, etc.
6. **Think concurrently** - Race conditions hide in shared state
